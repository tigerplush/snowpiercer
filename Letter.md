To my dear friend,

I hereby grant you full control of the eternal engine. It's fission powered nuclear core can pull and support up to 1000 cars with energy and warmth.
Each stop you can order a new car which my engineers will have ready at the stop after that. I will join you on the last stop with the 1000th car.
May god have mercy upon us and good luck to you all.

Mr. Wilford
of Wilford Industries
